Aloha uses API keys to allow access to the API endpoints. You need to authenticate each and every API request by including the API Key in the authorization header that looks like the following.

`Authorization: aloha_secret_key`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>aloha_secret_key</code> with your personal API key.

Please contact aloha@cbre.com for your API key.
